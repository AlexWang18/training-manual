                    In here you will find some miscellaneous tips for biking around the city and campus as well as
                    habits to practice to keep your bike in top condition.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wipe down and lube your regularly (at least once a week). </strong>
                            <br>
                            Depending on weather conditions, you may need to lube even more frequently to prevent gunk
                            building up.
                            Your chain picks up a lot of grit and grime riding through the city so to keep your
                            expensive drivetrain
                            healthier for longer wipe it with a clean rag while backpedaling. Afterwards apply a drop of
                            lube on each link
                            of the chain and wipe off the excess with a rag. Be sure to ride it in afterwards!

                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Always lock your bike while in public. </strong>
                            <br>
                            A simple cable lock works well on campus and deters any opportunistic thieves.
                            Try to find an immovable object (like a bike rack) in a well trafficked area to lock your
                            bike at. Make sure to lock your frame to the immovable object, or else
                            a thief could just remove your wheel and take off with the rest of your bike! Ideally your
                            lock should go around your backwheel, frame and a bike rack.
                            Good spots around campus include: the <strong> Posvar underpass, Barco Law Building on
                                Forbes, and Benedum </strong> .

                        <li><strong>Wear a helmet!</strong>
                            Although studies have shown that wearing a helmet causes drivers to pass closer to you (
                            <a target="_blank"
                                href="https://www.bicycling.com/news/a25358099/drivers-give-helmet-cyclists-less-room/">source</a>
                            ). It's still a good idea to wear a helmet as it could potentially save your life. Look for
                            a helmet that fits
                            snugly and has vents to let your head breathe. MIPS, a new technology incorporated in higher
                            end helmets, reduces
                            trauma to the brain in the case of oblique impacts.

                        <li><strong>Ride confidently and be predictable. </strong>
                            <br>
                            With no bike lanes, use an entire lane on the road if necessary. Don't ride too close too
                            the curb
                            as you risk being hit by an opening door. If a car passes you they should be crossing the
                            center line to ensure you
                            have enough space. Follow traffic laws and don't make unexpected movements. Make sure to
                            also have a front and rear light for when it gets dark.
                            And if you don't have lights don't worry! The <strong>Pitt Bike Cave</strong> has lights
                            currently available for
                            free.

                            <br>
                            To be more predictable utilize hand signals to let drivers know your next moves. Simply
                            pointing in the direction you are turning
                            can give motorists a good idea of what you are doing.
