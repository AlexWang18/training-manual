# Pitt Personal Bike Maintenance Manual

This website is a guidebook on bike maintenance for Pitt students. Our mission is to provide Pitt students with reliable and useful information to help them maintain their bike economically and integrate themselves and others into the Pittsburgh biking community. Our guide is organized into 6 parts: The intro (you are here), Skills, Tips, Resources, Inclusion, and Ethics. Description of the sections are as follows:

+ Intro: Welcome to our guidebook, learn all about us and how to contribute.
+ Skills: Learn maintenance skills such as fixing a flat or adjusting a brake cable.
+ Tips: Learn some tricks to keep your bike in tip top shape and/or learn how to fix things on the fly.
+ Resources: Learn about resources available to you. Need a workshop? Want some routes? Having trouble finding a community? Your answers are here.
+ Inclusion: Get others involved.
+ Ethics: Become informed ethical decisions when it comes to working on your bike and participating in the community.
